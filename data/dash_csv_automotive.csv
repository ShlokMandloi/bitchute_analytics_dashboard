In some ways the Shotgun offers a larger capacity and more powerful option that more closely aligns with many of the 350 models, finally giving those who like the retro style and more relaxed motorcycle, but still want a bit more performance than those 350s offer.

Alpina, the esteemed Bavarian tuning company, has unveiled the B3 and B4 GT variants, adding a touch of grand touring elegance to their lineup. These new models offer just enough additional power to set them apart from their BMW counterparts, the M3 and M4, while maintaining the refined luxury and performance that Alpina is renowned for.


The Alpina B3 GT and B4 GT build on the solid foundations of the BMW 3 Series and 4 Series, respectively. The changes may appear subtle at first glance, but they are precisely what set the Alpina variants apart. Both models now bear the prestigious GT badge, highlighting their grand touring credentials and unique character.


Under the hood, the B3 GT and B4 GT are powered by Alpina’s enhanced version of BMW’s turbocharged inline-six engine. This powerplant receives a mild performance boost, delivering just enough extra horsepower and torque to give the Alpina models a slight edge over their BMW counterparts without overshadowing the more aggressive M3 and M4.


Alpina’s tuning philosophy extends beyond raw power; it’s about achieving a harmonious balance between performance and comfort. The B3 GT and B4 GT exemplify this approach. While they offer spirited driving dynamics and ample power, they also prioritize ride comfort and refinement.


The suspension systems of the B3 GT and B4 GT are meticulously tuned to provide a supple yet composed ride, ideal for long-distance cruising or spirited drives on winding roads. Alpina’s expertise in chassis dynamics ensures precise and confidence-inspiring handling, striking the perfect balance between sportiness and comfort.


The design of the Alpina B3 GT and B4 GT reflects the brand’s philosophy of understated elegance. Although they share the same silhouette as their BMW counterparts, they feature subtle styling enhancements that set them apart.

What's so special about Tim Lally Chevrolet?


The team here at Tim Lally Chevrolet is proud to carry on the legacy of Tim Lally. The Lally name has been synonymous with exceptional customer experience and value since 1922. You read that right, 1922. Tom ""Poppy"" Lally left US Steel to work for Horton Chevrolet Company. During the Great Depression, Poppy and Grandma Jo worked without wages, only stock, a sacrifice that laid the foundation for the transition over the decades from Horton Chevrolet Company to Tim Lally Chevrolet.


Tim Lally Chevrolet is not a mega-store conglomerate that churns customers and employees through some corporate machine that maximizes profitability while projecting some agency managed image. We are real people helping real people just like you!


Tim Lally Chevrolet is a state of the art Chevrolet Sales and Service store that folks have known for years and that knows them. Stop by and you will find Mike Lally talking with second or third generation repeat customers like they're old friends...because they are. You won't find him in his private jet or flaunting exotic luxury cars. Again, we are real people helping real people.  
Construction companies, fleet managers, police and fire chiefs look to Tim Lally Chevrolet for competitively bid vehicles backed by the kind of service that builds confident, long lasting relationships. We are real, and we are there for you.


Does this mean you pay more? Absolutely not! We are a high volume sales and service location. How can we not be with a loyal customer base that spans over 70 years served by three generations of the Lally family? Not only our volume but our long standing outstanding reputation with Chevrolet empowers us to provide you with great values and spectacular service year after year, generation after generation.


Whether you are looking at our exciting new Chevrolet vehicles;..

<https://weymouthspeedweek.com/index.php/eventinformation/history>  
Weymouth Speed Week began in 1972 under the direction of the Royal Yachting Association (RYA). It was seen as the premier event at which boats could demonstrate their prowess, reach world-record breaking speeds and further the advancement of sailing technology. Speed sailing records have been sanctioned by the World Sailing Speed Record Council (WSSRC) since 1972.


The speed trials of the 1970's and 80's attracted many thousands of pounds of sponsorship money and competitors attended by invitation. Several world speed records were set and then broken during these years, firstly with the boats and then, as technologies improved, by the windsurfers. Weymouth Speed Week competitors were some of the first to demonstrate the use of foils to improve speed.


During the second half of the 80's the increasing popularity and capability of windsurfers came to take and then dominate the speed records. Locations with more favourable and predictable wind conditions became the place to set records, and the importance of Weymouth Speed Week as a record-breaking location began to decline.


Its popularity remained however and, due to the voluntary efforts of a few individuals, Weymouth Speed Week progressed into the 1990s supported by Weymouth and Portland Borough Council, the Weymouth Sailing Centre and the Amateur Yacht Research Society who assisted by donating prizes each year. Such was the enthusiasm for the event that some individuals even made their sailing boats available for use as 'course boats' during the week. The efforts of all these organisations and individuals has ensured that Weymouth Speed Week is the enjoyable and exciting event that it is today.
